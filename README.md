## A simple ML project to build a wine classifier of top 10 wines
This project deals with predicting top 10 wines from a given data-set of shape(71322, 13) based on its description.

### Aim:
The aim of this project is to solely focus on the applications of 2 ML models

### Why should you commit to this project and what value does it hold?
- These days most projects have heavy coding to attain the highest accuracy and other metrics of any ML model but for an absolute beginner it can sometimes be overwhelming
- The goal is to give an overview of simplest steps involved in predicitve analysis

### Who is the target audience for this project?
1. An absolute beginner who, is equally dedicated to be an aspiring data scientist, is looking for the applications of simple ML models
2. An intermediate who ran out of ideas but would like to refine a simple ML model
3. An individual with their advanced knowledge to throw some insights 

### What ML models are used in this project?
1. Naive Bayes Model
2. Support Vector Model
