## A simple ML project to build a wine classifier
This project deals with predicting top 10 wines from a given data-set of shape(71322, 13) based on its description.

### Aim:
The aim of this project is to solely focus on the applications of 2 ML models

### Pre-requisites to access all the files of this repository
1. Operating System Windows/ios 
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. MS Excel


### What ML models are applied in this project?
1. Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Support Vector Classifier

### Why should you commit to this project and what value does it hold?
- Most projects these days have heavy coding for attaining high accuracies and other related metrics of ML models, but for an absolute beginner it can sometimes be overwhelming
- The goal here is to provide an overview of simplest steps involved in doing any predicitve analysis

### Who is the target audience for this project?
1. An absolute beginner who is overwhelmed by the massive complex coding around and looking for a simple project
2. An intermediate who ran out of ideas but would like to refine a simple predictive analysis
3. An individual with their advanced knowledge to throw some insights
